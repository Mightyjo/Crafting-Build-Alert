# Crafting Build Alert
Author: Mightyjo

Depends on: 
- LibAddonMenu-2.0
- LibZone

Optionally depends on:
- LibDebugLogger
- DebugLogViewer

This add-on will remind you to switch to a specified crafting build in your ESO Armory whenever you interact with a crafting station while equipped with another build.

It will also remind you to switch to a clobbering build in your ESO Armory if you enter a dungeon, trial, or arena wearing your crafting build.

# Settings
You can turn on debug logging if you're having a problem. If you have DebugLogViewer installed you'll be able to see the add-on working in a UI window. Otherwise, the log is stored in your saved variables whenever you quit or /reloadui.

# Support
